            <p align="right">The project is mainly aimed at providing a
secured and user friendly Online Voting System. The problem
of voting is still critical in terms of safety and security. This
system deals with the design and development of a computer-
based voting system using excel as backend db and user  in
order to provide a high performance with high security to the
voting system. </p>
            <p>Online Voting Systems have many advantages over the
traditional voting system. Some of these advantages are less
cost, faster generation results, easy accessibility, accuracy,
and low risk of human and mechanical errors. It is very
difficult to develop online voting system which can allow
security and privacy on the high level. Future development
focused to design a system which can be easy to use and will
provide security and privacy of votes on acceptable level by
proper authentication and processing section.</p>
                        <h1>Load Balancing in public cloud using google spreadsheet as db.</h1>
            <p>Load balancing is an essential technique used in cloud computing to optimize resource utilization and ensure that no single resource is overburdened with traffic. It is a process of distributing workloads across multiple computing resources, such as servers, virtual machines, or containers, to achieve better performance, availability, and scalability.</p>
